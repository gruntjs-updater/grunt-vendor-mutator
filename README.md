# grunt-vendor-mutator

> A Node Based Task to split a given CSS file into Vendor Specific versions to reduce prefix bloating.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-vendor-mutator --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-vendor-mutator');
```

## The "vendor_mutator" task






### Honestly, this project just splits out CSS files into vendor specific CSS files to lower overall payloads.
### We can document it further than that, but ATM it's not crucial to a project.
### It's a big win, client side, but if you can serve your partials off AWS it is relatively low-hanging fruit.
### I promise to provide better examples.
